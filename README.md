- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cal-DCosta
- 👀 I’m passionate about exploring how AI can push the boundaries of storytelling and content creation, particularly through the lens of sci-fi and drama thrillers.
- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on video generation from text and images, leveraging models like GANs,  Integrating my background in film directing and editing with AI technologies to innovate the way films are produced.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building an AI-driven all encompassing downloadable filmmaking tool(complete with built-ins) for generating characters, videos, audio, and GFX, suitable for PCs and Macs with specific specs.
                                      Seeking partners with expertise in AI, software development, or creative design to revolutionize content creation together.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the idea of artificial intelligence in filmmaking isn't just about creating content? It's also about understanding audiences on a deeper level, predicting trends,
                 and personalizing experiences in ways we're just beginning to explore. As a filmmaker, I find this potential absolutely fascinating.
